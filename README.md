# TypeScript esbuild starter

This template comes with the bare minimum required to build and test a TypeScript Node app or website.

## Build
`npm run build` uses [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io) to produce an ESModule production bundle.

## Dev
Same as build, but with watch enabled.

## Configuration
There are two configurations ready to go, one for node and one for browser.

For further customisation, have a look at esbuild's [simple options](https://esbuild.github.io/api/#simple-options) page

## Test
By default, Mocha will run all the tests that follow the `*.spec.ts` naming convention.

You run them by calling `npm run test`.

Test coverage can be seen by calling `npm run coverage`.
